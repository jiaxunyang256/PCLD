PCLDetector: Multi-Modal CPCL Detection with Alignment & Knowledge-Enhanced Modules

## Description
PCLDetector is a multi-modal model designed to detect Chinese Patronizing and Condescending Language (CPCL) — an implicitly discriminatory toxic speech — in Chinese videos. It addresses limitations of existing datasets by leveraging the expanded PCLMMPLUS dataset (831 video samples + 103k user comments) and integrates two core modules:

Alignment Selection Module: Unifies spatiotemporal dimensions of video, facial, audio, and text features to reduce cross-modal differences.
Knowledge-Enhanced Comment Content Module: Fuses sentiment knowledge graphs and comment processing to boost detection accuracy.
